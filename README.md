# Exploring adoption of new AdaptWest climate data into the species habitat models

## Overview 

In the ABMI species habitat models, we include a set of climate covariates to explain residual variation in our landcover based models. This climate data was created by Diana Stralberg by interpolating existing climate data created using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) and downscaled to a 500-m resolution using the Climate WNA tool. As we are reviewing our modeling framework, we decided to explore alternative climate data sources that would provide the following benefits:

- Use more recent climate normal data that matches when ABMI surveys occurred (e.g., 1991-2020 climate normal).
- Provides us with more climate variables that could be incorporated into our models.
- Expands the spatial extent so we can use a single source of climate data for analyses both within and outside of Alberta.
- Acquire data from a source that also have climate projections to support any future climate change work.

We would like to acknowledge AdaptWest for providing the climate data used in this analysis
