This climate data was created by Diana Stralberg by interpolating existing climate data created using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) and downscaled to a 500-m resolution using the Climate WNA tool. As we are reviewing our modeling framework, we decided to explore alternative climate data sources that would provide the following benefits: Use more recent climate normal data that matches when ABMI surveys occurred (e.g., 1991-2020 climate normal). Provides us with more climate variables that could be incorporated into our models. Expands the spatial extent so we can use a single source of climate data for analyses both within and outside of Alberta. Acquire data from a source that also have climate projections to support any future climate change work. 1.1 Acknowledgements We would like to acknowledge AdaptWest and Daymetfor providing the climate data used in this analysis. 1.2 Suggested citation Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. 2023.

Some of the data relevant to the ABMI are their 30 year climate normals, multiple climate change models, and climate refugia models. For this analysis, we downloaded the 1-km 1961-1990 climate normal data and compared it to the current climate data used by the ABMI. In addition, we downloaded climate normal data for all years that were available (1971-2000, 1981-2010. 1991-2020) to understand how climate normals have shifted over time. The AdaptWest climate normal data contains 33 bioclimatic variables, 6 of which are current used in the ABMI species habitat models.

They provide information an annual averages for five variables: minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, and snow water equivalent. Annual totals, as well as daily weather are also available for the variables. 30-year climate normals are not available, though they could be reconstructed from the annual averages. 2.3 Analysis For climate variables available through AdaptWest and currently used by the ABMI, we compared the 1961-1990 climate normals to validate the similarity of the two datasets. In addition, compared the correlation between the ABMI 1961-1900 climate normals and AdaptWest 1991-2020 as well as the AdaptWest 1961-1900 climate normals and AdaptWest 1991-2020. This will help us understand how much the the climate normals have shifted over time and how that might impact the next iteration of our species habitat models. For the Daymet data, we used visualizations available through their website to assess the spatial coverage of this data.

"],["discussion.html", "4 Discussion", " 4 Discussion Overall, the data available through AdaptWest is highly correlated with our current climate data. In addition, we notice slight changes in our climate data when comparing the 1961-1990 and 1991-2020 climate normals. These similarities suggest that adopting the AdaptWest data into our species habitat models should have minimal impacts while providing the following benefits: Can use more recent climate normal data that matches when ABMI surveys occurred (e.g., 1991-2020 climate normal). Provides us with more climate variables that could be incorporated into our models. Expands the spatial extent so we can use a single source of climate data for analyses both within and outside of Alberta. Acquire data from a source that also have climate projections to support any future climate change work. The Daymet data also covers all of North America, making it suitable for expanding analyses outside of Alberta. However, climate normals would have to be calculated from their annual predictions and their are no climate scenarios produced by Daymet. In addition, this data source has fewer climatic variables. However, the fact that they do produce daily esimates for these variables could be informative for certain projects. Currently, the ABMI Science Centre is discussing if we will adopt this change.
