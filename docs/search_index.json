This climate data was created by Diana Stralberg by interpolating existing climate data created using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) and down-scaled to a 500-m resolution using the Climate WNA tool. As we are reviewing our modeling framework, we decided to explore alternative climate data sources that would provide the following benefits: Use more recent climate normal data that matches when ABMI surveys occurred (e.g., 1991-2020 climate normal). Provides us with more climate variables that could be incorporated into our models. Expands the spatial extent so we can use a single source of climate data for analyses both within and outside of Alberta. Acquire data from a source that also have climate projections to support any future climate change work. Create down-scaled predictions for any survey locations monitored by the ABMI. The full details outlining our assessment, and our new process for acquiring climate data can be found at the associated GitHub page (https://abbiodiversity.github.io/ClimateData/). 1.1 Acknowledgements We would like to acknowledge AdaptWest and Daymetfor providing the climate data used in this analysis, as well as the ClimateNA_v7.40 software for creating down-scaled predictions. 1.2 Suggested citation Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. 2023.

"],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 AdaptWest 2.2 Daymet 2.3 Analysis", " 2 Methods 2.1 AdaptWest This is a spatial database that provides freely available climate data across North America. Some of the data relevant to the ABMI are their 30 year climate normals, multiple climate change models, and climate refugia models. In addition, we are able to use their ClimateNA software (v7.40) to create down-scaled predictions for any survey locations monitored by the ABMI. For this analysis, we downloaded the 1-km 1961-1990 climate normal data and compared it to the current climate data used by the ABMI. In addition, we downloaded climate normal data for all years that were available (1971-2000, 1981-2010. 1991-2020) to understand how climate normals have shifted over time. The AdaptWest climate normal data contains 33 bioclimatic variables, 6 of which are current used in the ABMI species habitat models.

They provide information an annual averages for five variables: minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, and snow water equivalent. Annual totals, as well as daily weather are also available for theses variables. 30-year climate normals are not available, though they could be reconstructed from the annual averages. 2.3 Analysis For climate variables available through AdaptWest and currently used by the ABMI, we compared the 1961-1990 climate normals to validate the similarity of the two datasets. In addition, we assessed the correlation between the ABMI 1961-1900 climate normals and AdaptWest 1991-2020, as well as the AdaptWest 1961-1900 climate normals and AdaptWest 1991-2020. This will help us understand how much the the climate normals have shifted over time and how that might impact the next iteration of our species habitat models. For the Daymet data, we used the visualizations available through their website to assess the spatial coverage of this data product. However, due the the 30-year climate normals not being readily available, we did not perform any in depth comparisons to the current ABMI climate data and the products available through AdaptWest. "],["results.html", "3 Results 3.1 ABMI versus AdaptWest 3.2 Example variables extracted from the AdaptWest 30-year Climate Normals 3.3 Daymet Annual Climate Data", " 3 Results 3.1 ABMI versus AdaptWest The data currently used by the ABMI (1961-1990) and the 1961-1990 climate normals acquired from AdaptWest are highly correlated. In addition, we observed similar correlation patterns when comparing the 1961-1990 and 1991-2020 climate normals, regardless of their source.

"],["outcomes.html", "4 Outcomes", " 4 Outcomes Overall, the data available through AdaptWest is highly correlated with our current climate data. In addition, we notice slight changes in our climate data when comparing the 1961-1990 and 1991-2020 climate normals. These similarities suggest that adopting the AdaptWest data into our species habitat models should have minimal impacts while providing the following benefits: Can use more recent climate normal data that matches when ABMI surveys occurred (e.g., 1991-2020 climate normal). Provides us with more climate variables that could be incorporated into our models. Expands the spatial extent so we can use a single source of climate data for analyses both within and outside of Alberta. Acquire data from a source that also have climate projections to support any future climate change work. Create down-scaled predictions for any survey locations monitored by the ABMI. The Daymet data also covers all of North America, making it suitable for expanding analyses outside of Alberta. However, climate normals would have to be calculated from their annual predictions and their are no climate scenarios produced by Daymet. In addition, this data source has fewer climatic variables. However, the fact that they do produce daily estimates for these variables could be informative for certain projects. The ABMI Science Centre has decided to adopt using the AdaptWest data for future development of our species habitat models. Details for how the products available through AdaptWest and the ClimateNA software is outlines in the Process section. "],["process.html", "5 Process 5.1 Provincial Climate Surface 5.2 Site level Summaries", " 5 Process For the core species habitat models developed by the ABMI, we have adopted the following process for using and extracting relevant climate data. Projects outside the scope of the core species habitat models may use alternative sources of climate data depending on the needs of the project. Any questions about this process, or how to calculate specific information, can be directed to Brandon Allen (brandon.allen@ualberta.ca). 5.1 Provincial Climate Surface To create a 1-km2 climate surface for Alberta, we used the ClimateNA software (version 7.4) and queried the API using the ClimateNRr package. This package is freely available and allows users to batch process large amounts of climate data through R. The core ClimateNA software also allows batch processing, so either can be used depending on our application. Though you can perform a query through the ClimateNA web API, we recommend downloading the software and making requests locally. This maintains the confidentiality of our sites as is quicker due to the rate limits the web API has in place (100 sites per request, 100 requests per day). The ClimateNA software requires three pieces of information Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation. For our 1-km2 climate surface, Latitude and Longitude were calculated from the centroid of each polygon. Elevation was calculated as the mean value derived from ALOS World 3D (version 3.2) which is a global 30m digital surface model. The new climate data was then combined with other relevant attributes (e.g., natural subregions, percent water, etc) to create a new kgrid that will support our analyses. A detailed script for how this extraction was performed can be found in this repository (src/02-climate-extraction.R). In addition, details about the new kgrid can be found in our internal technical document repository. 5.2 Site level Summaries We now that we have the ability to create site specific climate information. Climate data for survey locations will be processed as follows: If the site coordinates are publicly available, users can extract their own climate data. However, if the site locations are not public, climate extractions will be requested through the Geospatial Centre. In situations where elevation data is unavailable for a survey location, climate data will be extracted from the the new kgrid based solely on their coordinates.
